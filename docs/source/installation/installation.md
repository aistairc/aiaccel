python3 -m venv optenv
~~~

In this guide, the virtual environment is named "optenv", but you can name it something else.

### Activating virtual environments

Execute the following command for activating the virtual environment.

~~~bash
source optenv/bin/activate
~~~

The following procedures assume that the virtual environment is activated.


> [!NOTE]
> You can deactivate virtual environments by using the following command.
> ~~~bash
> deactivate
> ~~~


### Installing aiaccel

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend you upgrade pip and setuptools beforehand.
> Execute the command `python -m pip --version` in order to verify that pip is running in the virtual environment, and then upgrade them. Be careful not to use the pip on other environments.
>
> ~~~bash
> python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
> ~~~
