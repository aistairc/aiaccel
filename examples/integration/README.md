# Example of Black Box Optimization on ABCI 3.0

This is an example of performing black-box optimization of the learning rate for a ResNet50 model on the MNIST dataset.

## Getting started

In an environment where aiaccel is installed, additionally install TensorBoard and torchvision.

```bash
pip install tensprboard torchvision
```

Run the following command to perform black-box optimization.

```bash
python -m aiaccel.hpo.apps.optimize --config config_abci.yaml
```
