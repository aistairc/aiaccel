# How to run examples

## Abstract of examples

In examples directory, five kinds of examples can be tested.
The directory name means the target application to test.
For example, `sphere` directory is sphere function.

This software supports two environments: local and abci, and five search algorithm: random search, grid search, sobol sequence, nelder mead and TPE.
These environments and algorithm can be changed in configuration file.
Please edit the configuration file in the example directory if you wanto to run your choices.

- Environment
  - Environment local means that the software runs on your local computer.
  - Environment abci means that you access to [ABCI](https://abci.ai/) and run your program on it.
- Search algorithm
  - Search algorithm: random search means that the software searches hyperparameters at random.
  - Search algorithm: grid search means that the software searches exhaustive search over hyperparameters.
  - Search algorithm: sobol sequence means that the software searches hyperparameters following the [sobol sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobol_sequence).
  - Search algorithm: nelder mead means that the optimizer searches hyperparameters following the [nelder mead method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method).
  - Search algorithm: TPE means that the optimizer searches hyperparameters following the [TPE(Tree-structed Parzen Estimator Approach)](https://www.lri.fr/~kegl/research/PDFs/BeBaBeKe11.pdf).

    source work/bin/activate
~~~

2. Prepare sphere workspace. Thease processes are same with [sphere tutorial on local computer](#sphere tutorial on local computer) from 2 to 4.

3. Please confirm the configuration file before running master.
```yaml
resource:
  type: "ABCI"
  num_node: 4
```
4. Run
~~~
    > python -m aiaccel.start --config config.yaml

# Inputs
The inputs for the system is files as follows:
* config.yaml
  * A input file for the master program of this software.
* job_script_preamble.sh
  * A preamble of shell script to run your target programs on ABCI environment.
* wrapper.py
  * A wrapper program defines how the software sets hyperparameters and inputs, and how the software gets the results from your target programs.
* and your target programs
  * Your target programs which need to get hyperparameters with arguments in CUI environment. Please don't forget the specify your target program in `wrapper.py`.

# Outputs
The outputs of the system is placed on a directory.
The directory can be set in config.yml.
In the directory, the system makes sub directories as follows:

* abci_output
  * stdout/stderr outputs from ABCI are stored in this directory.
* alive
  * The alive files for each module are placed on this directory. If a alive file for master program is deleted, the master program will stop.
  * files
    * master.yml
    * optimizer.yml
    * scheduler.yml
* hp/finished
  * A hyperparameter directory which finished hyperparameters are placed.
  * files
    * for example, ${ID}.yml
* hp/ready
  * A hyperparameter directory which ready to starting hyperparameters are placed.
* hp/running
  * A hyperparameter directory that currently running hyperparameters are placed.
* lock

# Future works
- Get accurate timestamps and measure the running time.
- Parallel execution on one interactive node.
- Support databases to store the states and results.
- Manage multiple master programs.
- Make references such as docstring.
- Implement a dashboard as web applications.
- Implement the API to control the optimization.
- If the optimizer has the state and the total hyperparameters are greater than requested running number, how the optimizer determines the order of generation of the hyperparameters for example in grid search case.
- Error checks for config, parameters and so on. For example, min_value and max_value...
- Add a trouble shooting document, about the [Argparse issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9025204/python-argparse-issue-with-optional-arguments-which-are-negative-numbers).
- Build executable binaries.
- Type hints.
- Support pathlib.
- Synchronization of re-run.
- Error detections for user applications.
- Refactor the codes. Line feeds manner, single quotation and double quotation, and so on.
